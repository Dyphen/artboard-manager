# Sketch Artboard Manager

This plugin automatically arranges the position of all Artboards in your Sketch document, to snap them to rows & columns.

It’s still a work in progress (for one, it doesn’t even have an easy way to change the config…) but it’ll eventually get better.

## TODO

- Arrange artboards on artboard deletion
- UI for editing preferences
